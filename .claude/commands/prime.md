# Prime — Load TigerMate Context

Read and understand the Tiger M.A.T.E project:

1. Read project rules: CLAUDE.md
2. Read the PRD: docs/prd.md
3. Scan current folder structure: src/
4. Check what features are implemented vs planned
5. Read recent git log (last 10 commits)

Provide:
- Summary of what Tiger M.A.T.E is
- Current state of implementation (what's built, what's not)
- What should be built next based on PRD priority
- Any issues or gaps you notice

Do not implement anything yet.
